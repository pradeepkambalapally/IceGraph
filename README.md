# <p align="center">IceGraph</p>

**IceGraph** provides an interactive, hierarchical view of **Apache Iceberg** metadata. It maps the DNA of your tables—from root metadata down to individual data and delete files.

Look at Live Demo! [https://yanivzalach.github.io/IceGraph/](https://yanivzalach.github.io/IceGraph/)

> **Opinionated Design**: IceGraph is built exclusively for **Spark Connect** backends.

> **Table Version**: Currently IceGraph officially supports Table Version 2.



## 🛠 Features

* **Read-Only**: The application is read-only and does not modify the table.
* **Time-Travel**: View the physical state of your table as of any `datetime`.
* **Metadata Inspector**: Displaying record counts, stats, and file paths.
* **Table History**: Trace every metadata evolution, from schema changes to snapshot writes, across the full lifetime of the table.
* **Table File Browser**: See your table's files group by partition, just like you use to.
* **Branches**: View all the branches of the table, even when detached from the main branch.

> **Recommended**: In production, use a user with read-only permissions for the Spark Connect server, for extra peace of mind.

## Mock Data Example Using Docker

Clone the repo, and in it, go to:
```
cd docker_demo
```

Run the docker compose:
```
docker compose up
```

Go to `http://localhost:5000` and explore table `default.events` and table `default.logging`.

## Quick Start Using Docker

The easiest way to run IceGraph is via [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/yanivzalach/icegraph)

### Spark connect 3.5.4

```bash
docker run -e SPARK_REMOTE=sc://<spark-connect-ip>:15002 -p 5000:5000 yanivzalach/icegraph:latest
```

### Other Spark Connect versions

Clone the repo, update the Spark Connect version in `backend/pyproject.toml`, then build from the project root:
```bash
docker build -t icegraph .
```

Then run with the same command:
```bash
docker run -e SPARK_REMOTE=sc://<spark-connect-ip>:15002 -p 5000:5000 icegraph
```

## Start Using Source Code

### Prerequisites

- npm
- UV (python)
- Python 3.9

### 1. Setup

Sync the environments:

```bash
cd backend
uv sync
```

```bash
cd frontend
npm i
```

### 2. Setup your Envs

We will create an `.env` file in the root of the backend directory:

```bash
SPARK_REMOTE=sc://localhost:15002 # Our local testing spark, If you use docker, change it to your ip.
```

If you want to change the default values of the application, you can set the following environment variables:

- `MAX_NUMBER_OF_GRAPHS_TO_COMPUTE`: The maximum number of graphs to compute in parallel. Default is 15.
- `MAX_SNAPSHOTS_TO_SHOW`: The maximum number of snapshots to show in the snapshot selection page. Default is 2000.
- `COMPUTE_CLEANUP_TIME_SECONDS`: The time to wait before cleaning up the computed graphs. Default is 12.
- `MAX_DATA_FILES_TO_COLLECT`: The maximum number of data files to collect. Default is 5000.
- `MAX_SNAPSHOTS_TO_COMPUTE`: The maximum number of snapshots to compute. Default is 50.

### 3. Run

Open one terminal in the backend directory and run:

```bash
uv run python main.py
```

Open a second terminal in the front end directory and run:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Go to `http://localhost:3000` and explore your tables.
